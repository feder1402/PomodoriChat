# PomodoriChat

PomodoriChat is a real-time team communication tool with advanced features such as:

* Keeps a searchable history of all communications
* Can be accessesed from any mobile or web client
* Messages can be sent to individuals, groups, or channels. Channels can be open to everybody or private to a group of users
* Messages can contain markdown text, links, inline images & video, file attachments

What sets PomodoriChat appart from other real-time messaging projects is its support for [Pomodoro time-management technique](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). Pomodoro divides tasks into fixed size chuncks (25' by default) followed by small breaks. These intervals are known as "pomodori", the plural of the Italian word pomodoro for "tomato". The idea is that frequent breaks improves mental focus and prevents procastication.

For each user, PomodoriChat, will show their pomodori status. Using it, users can decide to interrupt or not a collegue and, if the person is inside a pomodoro session and therefore busy, to know how long until the college is free.
